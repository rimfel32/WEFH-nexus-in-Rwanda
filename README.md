Project Proposal

Project Title: Creating an AI-Enhanced System Dynamics Model for the Water-Energy-Food-Health (WEFH) Nexus in Rwanda.

This project aims to integrate qualitative insights with quantitative system dynamics modeling and AI-driven data analysis to improve understanding and decision-making around the complex interconnections between water, energy, food, and health systems in Rwanda.
How to build this model step-by-step:
1. Specific Objectives and Scope
Specific Objectives:
Model the dynamic interactions among Water, Energy, Food, and Health systems in Rwanda aims to:
•	Evaluate policy interventions (e.g., for climate resilience or rural development)
•	Optimize resource allocation
•	Improve cross-sectoral planning and budgeting processes 
Scope:
•	Geographical: National level (e.g., Eastern Province of Rwanda)
Temporal: Medium-term (2025–2040). I shall simulate this over 30 years (2025–2055), using simplified parameters for demonstration.
•	Focus areas: Agriculture, rural electrification, water access, nutrition, and healthcare
2. Context and Alignment with GCRI
2.1. Relevance to GCRI’s Mission
The proposed project aligns with GCRI’s mission that emphasizes innovation, risk intelligence, and democratic collaboration between civil society, industry, academia, and government. The NEXUS-AI initiative supports:
•	Resilience building through data-driven, system-aware planning.
•	Technological innovation via machine learning for regional risk detection.
•	Capacity development with open-access tools and workshops.
•	Policy and societal impact aligned with the GCRI-OBSERVATORY 2024-10 report’s emphasis on systems transformation and governance intelligence.
2.2. Relevance to regional needs
East Africa (including Rwanda, as a country, member of East Africa community) faces recurring challenges from:
•	Climate-induced water scarcity.
•	Energy access gaps and over-reliance on hydropower.
•	Food insecurity driven by agricultural shocks.
•	Health vulnerabilities from nutrition and water-borne diseases.
3. Identification of key components and variables
Water:
•	Availability (rainfall, groundwater, surface water)
•	Access to clean water
•	Irrigation infrastructure
•	Water demand (agriculture, households, energy production)
Energy:
•	Access to electricity (rural vs. urban)
•	Energy sources (hydro, solar, biomass)
•	Energy use in irrigation, food processing, and health clinics
Food:
•	Crop production
•	Land use
•	Fertilizer use
•	Nutrition levels
Health:
•	Disease prevalence (waterborne, malnutrition-related)
•	Healthcare infrastructure
•	Access to health services
•	Health outcomes (stunting, under-five mortality rate)
4. Build a System Dynamics Model (Structure)
Use Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs) and Stock-and-Flow Diagrams (SFDs).
Example Feedback Loops:
•	Water → Agriculture → Nutrition → Health (positive loop)
•	Deforestation → Reduced Rainfall → Lower Water Availability (negative loop)
•	Energy Access → Irrigation Efficiency → Food Production (positive loop)
•	Poor Health → Lower Labor Productivity → Reduced Food Production (reinforcing negative loop)
Tool:
Use SD software like Vensim, Stella, or AnyLogic to construct the model.

5. Integrate AI for Support and Enhancement
AI can support this SD model through:
(a) Data Integration and Cleaning
•	Use machine learning for missing data imputation (e.g., rainfall gaps)
•	Use natural language processing (NLP) to extract WEFH indicators from reports
(b) Predictive Analytics
•	Train ML models (e.g., Random Forests, LSTMs) on:
o	Rainfall → Crop yield
o	Energy access → Clinic performance
o	Nutrition → Health outcomes
(c) Optimization
•	Use reinforcement learning or genetic algorithms to optimize policy levers:
 Policy levers are the tools and strategies that policymakers use to influence outcomes and achieve desired policy goals.
o	Investment in solar irrigation vs. fertilizer subsidy
o	Rural water infrastructure vs. health worker deployment
(d) Scenario Simulation
AI-generated scenarios for:
•	Climate change (RCP 4.5, 8.5)
RCP 4.5 and 8.5 are Representative Concentration Pathways, which are different greenhouse gas concentration scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to project future climate change
•	Population growth
•	Technological adoption (e.g., solar pumps)
6. Data Sources for Rwanda
Source	Type	Variables
Rwanda DHS	Survey	Health, nutrition, water
FAO & MINAGRI	Agriculture	Crop production, irrigation
MININFRA	Energy	Access, usage
Rwanda Meteorological Agency	Climate	Rainfall, temperature
World Bank, WHO	Health, Infrastructure	Clinics, electricity, water

7. Example Submodule: Water for Agriculture
Stocks:
•	Water storage (reservoirs, groundwater)
•	Soil moisture
Flows:
•	Inflow (rainfall, pumping)
•	Outflow (evaporation, crop uptake)
AI Integration:
•	LSTM model for predicting rainfall
•	Random Forest for water demand prediction

8. Output Metrics & Visualization
•	Food Security Index
•	Water Stress Index
•	Energy Reliability Score
•	Health Outcome Index (e.g., stunting rates)
Visualization tools:
•	Dashboards using Tableau, Power BI, or Python Dash
•	Dynamic scenario explorer (via SD platform)

9. Policy Testing & Scenarios
Test scenarios like:
•	Subsidized solar irrigation
•	Integrated rural water-energy-health investment
•	Climate-smart agriculture rollout
•	Drought or flood conditions

10. Example Use Case: Solar-Powered Irrigation
Model Pathway:
Solar pumps → Increased irrigation → Higher yields → Better income → Improved diet → Reduced stunting
AI Role:
•	Predict crop yields under solar vs. diesel irrigation
•	Optimize placement of solar systems based on yield gains

11. Implementation Roadmap
Phase	Activities
1. Stakeholder Engagement	Co-design with ministries (MINAGRI, MININFRA, MoH)
2. Data Collection	Integrate from DHS, FAO, meteorology, surveys
3. Model Development	SD + AI integration
4. Scenario Testing	Simulate 5-10 policy options
5. Policy Recommendations	Actionable strategies based on results
6. Capacity Building	Train local analysts and policymakers.
